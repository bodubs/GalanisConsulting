The building consists of an XRAY Room; Lab; Treatment Rooms; Student patient rooms; Triage; Two large multi-purpose rooms, and a conference room.<br><br>19 Geothermal wells were drilled 500 feet into the earth and are incorporated into the HVAC Systems. The project received a Gold Certificate for LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) from the US Green Building Council.<br><br>The building has joined Bulfinch Hall, and the Addison Gallery of American Art in the Academy’s growing roster of buildings sprouting green roofs.<br><br>The Garden Level features an exterior garden that was developed with local materials.
