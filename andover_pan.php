	<p>Construction started in Spring 2020 with the demolition of two former athletic buildings allowing the enabling work to relocate a utility corridor and roadway system.   The new 70,000-square-foot Pan Center will house a swimming pool with 525,000 gallons tank volume and diving area.   In addition, dance studios, wrestling facilities, and an Athletics Hall of Honor will be incorporated into the building.   The pool will consist of 8 main competition lanes; 10 practice lanes; one water polo course; and two 1M diving boards.  The Wrestling venue will consist of a multi-purpose room to include two 42x42 wrestling mats.<br><br>The new 3 story structure will be Phase A of ultimately 140,000 square feet of multi-purpose athletic facilities that will also include locker rooms, elevated 3-court gymnasium, fitness rooms, office space, training rooms, and double height atrium with lobbies.<br><br>Approximately 720 tons of structural steel; 210 kWDC Solar System; and two 65 kW micro-turbines are some of the components that will be incorporated into the construction.  The Project goal is to be LEED certified. <br><br></p>
