                management of academic, historic, institutional, commercial, industrial, casino, hotel, 
                and residential structures working directly for building owners and institutions. 
                His various supervisory positions from "hands on" supervision of field staff to the role 
                of Project Manager have allowed him to provide cost effective analysis and value to a 
                wide variety of projects. In the past 20 years Galanis Consulting has managed over $400 
                million in construction projects working directly for owners. Historic preservation work has allowed Galanis to work on buildings designed by some of the greatest American architects. The Somerset Club, and 39-40 Beacon Street projects restored buildings originally designed by Alexander Parris in the mid 1800s. Projects at Phillips Academy Andover restored buildings originally designed by Asher Benjamin, Charles Bulfinch, Charles Platt, and Guy Lowell. In addition, sensitive landscape design and work has taken place on this Frederick Law Olmstead campus.
