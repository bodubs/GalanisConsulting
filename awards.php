            <p>May 2018</p>

            <p>The Snyder Center, Phillips Academy’s new multipurpose athletic center, has achieved LEED Platinum certification from the United States Green Building 
                Council (USGBC). Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design is a globally recognized 
                rating system for sustainable building design and construction practices.</p>
            <p>The USGBC cited Andover as a “showcase example of sustainability” and a leader in helping to transform the building industry. 
                Innovation and care for the environment were top priorities in the construction of the Snyder Center. Rigorous sustainability 
                goals were either met or exceeded. As a result, the 98,000 square-foot facility has not increased the Academy’s overall consumption 
                of energy from fossil fuels. This is due in large part to features that include a roof-top solar array, efficient building envelope and 
                energy systems, and the reuse of waste heat from ice-making at the adjacent Harrison Hockey arena.</p>
