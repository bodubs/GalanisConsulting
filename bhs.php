	<p>A pre-existing gym, rink, garage, and small clapboard office structure were removed and the new athletics center built in the same general area. The 16 month construction schedule included multiple phases that included the demolition of the existing gym and rink. The project is the largest building ever constructed on the campus.<br><br>The first floor features an Olympic size hockey rink, 7 international squash courts, and wrestling room. In the off-season, the rink is converted to four indoor tennis courts. A dedicated weight-training room as well as alpine and cross-country skiing team rooms are within the facility. The facility also includes space for storage of athletic equipment, team rooms and upper and lower school lockers.<br><br>The upper level of the center has two regulation-sized basketball courts. In addition, there is a function room overlooking the hockey rink on one side and the Belmont Hill campus on the other.<br><br></p>
