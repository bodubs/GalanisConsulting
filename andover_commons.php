	<p>The Paresky Commons project renovated the 1930 Commons Dining Hall on the 1,100 student, 500 acre campus of Phillips Academy Andover. With a requirement of 3,300 meals per day to be served out of a temporary dining facility as the Phase 1 build out of the project, the Phase 2 renovation included two large serveries replacing the four installed in 1981; opening the first-floor servery to the lobby; creating a new stair to the basement-level student center; transforming and doubling the size of the former student center; making the building fully handicapped accessible; creating three large terraces; and providing a variety of seating options in the dining halls, including a café with its own menu and atmosphere.  Preserving and restoring the historic character of the building was central to every aspect of the renovation. Even the most radical changes-like opening the lobby to the servery beyond –were done so artfully as to seem no change at all took place. Matching existing Alabama Limestone walls, Tennessee Marble floors, and preserving Barry Faulkner murals all added a complex array of conditions.<br><br></p>
